# AIChatBotSimple

This is a cheap inexpesive way to create a chatbot that talks back to the user using AI responses.
This code is a small glipse of how inexpesive AI project can be come if the correct tools are used.

  THIS PROJECT WAS MADE BY A COLLEGE STUDENT TO HELP ENCOURAGE OTHER DEVELOPERS TO DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH ON API AND COME TO MORE COST EFFECT SOLUTIONS TO SIMPLE PROBLEMS.
  This code can technically be used without any money which colege CS personall could use more of.

Green API - https://green-api.com/ has instances for free on sending and revieve Whatsapp messages

I also used Makersuite by google https://makersuite.google.com/

This code does not have error handling or too much specific code as this is simple skelekton code/generic code.
